## 7. LESSONS FROM CHFS FOR BENCHFS

### 7.1 Architectural Insights

1. **Consistent Hashing Ring**
   - Elegant solution for distributed system topology
   - Enables dynamic node join/leave
   - Could be integrated as BenchFS's "ring mode"

2. **Two-Level Storage Hierarchy**
   - Fast (persistent memory) + slow (disk) model
   - Automatic promotion/demotion
   - Good for heterogeneous clusters

3. **I/O-Aware Flushing**
   - Respect latency thresholds
   - Batch asynchronous operations
   - Apply to BenchFS's write-back caching

4. **RDMA Tiering**
   - Separate logic: RPC for small, RDMA for large
   - Configurable threshold (32 KB default)
   - Could be experimented in BenchFS

### 7.2 Implementation Patterns

1. **RPC Handler Pattern**
   - Input parsing → Operation → Response
   - Works well for server implementations
   - Could inspire BenchFS handler design

2. **File Descriptor Management**
