## Key Insights Summary

### CHFS Strengths
1. **Proven Scalability**: 1024+ nodes tested
2. **Sub-millisecond Latency**: With persistent memory
3. **Elegant Topology**: Ring-based with automatic recovery
4. **Two-Level Hierarchy**: Fast cache + slow backend
5. **RDMA Optimization**: Threshold-based tiering

### BenchFS Opportunities
1. **Adopt Consistent Hashing**: Optional ring topology mode
2. **Two-Level Storage**: Fast (memory/PMDK) + slow (backend)
3. **I/O-Aware Flushing**: Respect latency thresholds
4. **RDMA Tiering**: 32 KB threshold for RPC vs RDMA
5. **Ring Election**: Elegant failure recovery mechanism

### Complementary Strengths
- **CHFS**: "What works" (production system)
- **BenchFS**: "Why it works" (measurement framework)
- **Together**: Performance understanding + optimization discovery

## Architecture Highlights

### Consistent Hashing Ring
- Servers form ordered ring by hash value
- O(log n) binary search lookup
- Dynamic node join/leave support
- Multiple pointer state for failure tolerance

### Two-Level Storage
```
L1 (Fast): pmemkv - persistent memory
  ├─ Latency: < 100 microseconds
  ├─ Capacity: Device-limited
  └─ Persistence: Automatic

L2 (Slow): POSIX backend - parallel file system
  ├─ Latency: 1-10 milliseconds  
  ├─ Capacity: Virtually unlimited
  └─ Use: Overflow + long-term storage
```

### RPC Operations
- **File System** (10 operations): create, stat, read, write, truncate, remove, etc.
- **Ring Maintenance** (6 operations): join, set_next, set_prev, list, election, coordinator

### Chunking Strategy
- Default: 64 KiB chunks
- File distributed as: /path:0, /path:1, /path:2, ...
- Each chunk hashed independently
- Enables parallel I/O

### Flushing Mechanism
- Asynchronous queue (FIFO)
- Deduplication (same file queued once)
- Multiple flush threads
- I/O-aware throttling
- Synchronization points

### Fault Tolerance
- Heartbeat-based failure detection
- Bully algorithm for election
- Ring topology automatic repair
- Multi-pointer state for resilience

| Component | LOC | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: RPC Handler
```
Receive RPC → Parse Input → Determine Location →
If Remote: Forward to Owner | If Local: Execute →
Send Response → Cleanup
```

### Pattern 2: File Descriptor Management
- Client-side buffer for I/O coalescing
- Thread-safe with mutexes
- Tracks file position, mode, chunk size

### Pattern 3: Ring Maintenance
- Heartbeat detects failures
- Election recovers from failures
- Multi-pointer state enables fast recovery

### Pattern 4: Backend Abstraction
- KV store (fast, limited)
- POSIX backend (slow, unlimited)
- Automatic fallback/promotion

### Pattern 5: RDMA Tiering
- Small: RPC (latency optimized)
- Large: RDMA (bandwidth optimized)
- Configurable threshold
