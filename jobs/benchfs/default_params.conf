# BenchFS Job Parameters Configuration

# This file defines the default parameters for BenchFS benchmarking jobs.
# You can override these by setting PARAM_FILE environment variable
# to point to a custom configuration file.

# IOR Transfer sizes
# Controls how much data is transferred in each I/O operation
# NOTE: block_size must be a multiple of transfer_size
transfer_size_list=(
  4m    # 4 MiB - small transfer size
  16m   # 16 MiB - moderate transfer size

# IOR Block sizes
# Defines the size of each block written per task
# NOTE: Must be a multiple of transfer_size (block_size >= transfer_size and block_size % transfer_size == 0)
block_size_list=(
  64m   # 64 MiB - small blocks (multiple of 4m and 16m)
  128m  # 128 MiB - medium blocks (multiple of 4m and 16m)
  256m  # 256 MiB - large blocks (multiple of 4m and 16m)

# Processes per node
# Number of MPI processes to spawn on each compute node
ppn_list=(

  2     # Two processes per node
  4     # Four processes per node

# IOR flags
# -w: write test
# -r: read test
# -F: file per process (each process writes to its own file)
ior_flags_list=(

# BenchFS chunk sizes (in bytes)
# Determines how data is divided into chunks for storage
