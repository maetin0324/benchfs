# BenchFS Job Parameters Configuration

# This file defines the default parameters for BenchFS benchmarking jobs.
# You can override these by setting PARAM_FILE environment variable
# to point to a custom configuration file.

# IOR Transfer sizes
# Controls how much data is transferred in each I/O operation
transfer_size_list=(
  16m   # 16 MiB - moderate transfer size

# IOR Block sizes
# Defines the size of each block written per task

  4m    # 4 MiB - small blocks
  16m   # 16 MiB - medium blocks
  64m   # 64 MiB - large blocks

# Processes per node
# Number of MPI processes to spawn on each compute node

# IOR flags
# -w: write test
# -r: read test
# -F: file per process (each process writes to its own file)

# BenchFS chunk sizes (in bytes)
