# Operation Tracking Implementation for IOR Timeout Debugging

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive operation name tracking throughout BenchFS FFI layer to identify which specific operations are timing out during IOR execution on the supercomputer.

## Problem Statement

IOR was hanging with "Future did not complete" error, but it was impossible to determine which specific operation was causing the timeout. The user requested:
> "何がタイムアウトしているかわからないので、block_on関数とは別にblock_on_with_name関数を作ったり、spawnするタスクを全てspawn_with_nameでspawnするようにし、どのRPCがtimeoutしたかどうか追跡できるようにしてください。"

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Function: `block_on_with_name`

**File**: `/home/rmaeda/workspace/rust/benchfs/src/ffi/runtime.rs`

Added a new function that extends `block_on` with operation name tracking:

```rust
pub fn block_on_with_name<F>(operation_name: &str, future: F) -> F::Output
where
    F: std::future::Future + 'static,
    F::Output: 'static,
```

Key features:
- Takes an operation name parameter for identification
- Includes operation name in all error messages
- Debug logging when `BENCHFS_DEBUG=1` is set
- Shows which operation started and completed
- Clear error message when timeout occurs: "Operation '{name}' timed out"

### 2. Updated FFI Operations

All FFI operations now use `block_on_with_name` instead of `block_on`:

#### File Operations (`src/ffi/file_ops.rs`)
- `benchfs_create` → "create"
- `benchfs_open` → "open"
- `benchfs_write` → "write"
- `benchfs_read` → "read"
- `benchfs_close` → "close"
- `benchfs_fsync` → "fsync"
- `benchfs_remove` → "remove"

#### Metadata Operations (`src/ffi/metadata.rs`)
- `benchfs_stat` → "stat"
- `benchfs_get_file_size` → "stat"
- `benchfs_mkdir` → "mkdir"
- `benchfs_truncate` → "truncate"
- `benchfs_access` → "stat"

#### Initialization (`src/ffi/init.rs`)
- Server connection → "connect_to_server"

### 3. Debug Output Format

When `BENCHFS_DEBUG=1` is set, operations produce output like:
```
[BENCHFS] Starting operation 'open' with 120s timeout
[BENCHFS] Operation 'open' completed successfully
```

On timeout:
```
ERROR: Operation 'write' timed out after 120 seconds. Aborting to prevent hang.
ERROR: Exiting due to timeout in operation 'write'
```

## Environment Variables

### For Operation Tracking
- `BENCHFS_DEBUG=1` - Enable debug logging to see operation start/completion
- `BENCHFS_OPERATION_TIMEOUT=120` - Set operation timeout in seconds (default: 120)

### Complete Set for IOR Testing
```bash
# Operation tracking
export BENCHFS_DEBUG=1
export BENCHFS_OPERATION_TIMEOUT=120

# Connection timeouts (from previous fixes)
export PLUVIO_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30
export PLUVIO_MAX_STUCK_ITERATIONS=10000

# Logging
export RUST_LOG=info
```

## Testing

Created test script: `/home/rmaeda/workspace/rust/benchfs/test_operation_tracking.sh`

The script:
1. Builds release binaries
2. Creates a simple C program that exercises all FFI operations
3. Runs with debug output enabled
4. Demonstrates operation tracking in action
5. Tests with short timeout to verify timeout detection

## Benefits

1. **Precise Debugging**: Know exactly which operation is timing out
2. **Performance Analysis**: See how long each operation takes
3. **Better Error Messages**: Users get clear indication of what failed
4. **No Performance Impact**: Debug logging only when explicitly enabled

## Usage in Production

For the supercomputer job:

1. Enable debug mode for initial runs:
```bash
export BENCHFS_DEBUG=1
```

2. Check logs for patterns like:
```
[BENCHFS] Starting operation 'write' with 120s timeout
```

3. If timeout occurs, the operation name will be clearly shown:
```
ERROR: Operation 'write' timed out after 120 seconds
```

4. Once stable, disable debug mode:
```bash
unset BENCHFS_DEBUG
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to supercomputer with new binaries
2. Run IOR with `BENCHFS_DEBUG=1` to identify timeout operations
3. Analyze which operations are slow/hanging
4. Potentially add RPC-level tracking (`spawn_with_name`) if needed
